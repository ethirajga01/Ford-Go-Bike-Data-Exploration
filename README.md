# Ford Go Bike Data Exploration

## Dataset

The 2019-fordgobike-tripdata.csv dataset, obtained from Udacity, comprises 183,142 trips with 16 attributes, including location, time, and user information. The dataset includes both start and end stations, and upon examination, it was observed that the majority of trips occur at the same stations. To further analyze the data, a subset was created by selecting the top 10 start stations with the highest number of trips.



## Summary

The results of the exploration are detailed below:

Univariate exploration: The number of trips taken during the day is highest in the morning and afternoon, with fewer trips taken at night. Additionally, more trips are taken during weekdays compared to weekends. This trend is consistent with the fact that there are more subscribers than customers. Among the gender groups, the number of trips taken by males is higher than other groups. The average age of riders is 33 years old.

Bivariate exploration: After identifying Top 10 stations where the maximum rides originate, the findings across groups were consistent the gender and time driven univariate analysis. 

Multivariate exploration:  There was a drastic change with the user_type composition where customer group was more than that of the subscriber which was the opposite of bivariate exploration. The heatmap confirmed the same with customer spending more time on the rides compared to subscriber. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

I explain my initial findings based on the visual inspection and analysis of the dataset. I then present my findings on user segmentaion, distribution of age and gender. The Top 10 station where a ride originates is depicted which forms the base for further analysis which is supported by the use of bar chart and heatmap.
